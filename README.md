# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Classification using ResNet18

This project implements a deep learning model using **ResNet18** to classify brain MRI images into four categories:

- **Glioma Tumor**
- **Meningioma Tumor**
- **Pituitary Tumor**
- **No Tumor**

The model achieved an impressive **accuracy of approximately 98%** on the validation dataset.

## ðŸš€ Model Overview

We used **transfer learning** with a pre-trained ResNet18 model, fine-tuning the final layer for 4-class classification. The model was trained using PyTorch on a labeled dataset of brain MRI images.

### ðŸ§ª Accuracy:
- **Training Accuracy:** ~99%
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~98%
